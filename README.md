## Overview
🤔 Diabetes is a prevalent health concern, and early prediction can aid in timely intervention and management. This project utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict the onset of diabetes based on various health parameters.

## Dataset
📈 The dataset contains health-related information such as glucose levels, blood pressure, and BMI of individuals from the Pima Native American tribe. It's widely used in research for diabetes prediction.

## Approach
🔍 We explore multiple machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forests to find the best model for diabetes prediction.

## Usage
💻 To use this project:

- Clone the repository.
- Run the notebook or scripts to train and evaluate the models. (requirees kaggle)
- Analyze the results and fine-tune the models as needed.

## Results
📈 We evaluate the models based on accuracy and F1 score, providing insights into their performance and suitability for diabetes prediction.
